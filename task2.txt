It is not clear what is supposed to be tested, so I list here the most general features which in my opinion must be tracked. 
It is also hard to choose three metrics, so I list the features which in my opinion are the most important.
They provide a powerful base for creating the metrics specific for the use case, as well as the information for deeper analysis.

What needs to be tracked: 

	1. Click: 1 or 0 - this is a good alternative to conversion, since it measures the users interest in feature.
	It also can provide more insights into the users behaviour and the reasons why the user did not convert.
	For example, when something was clicked but it did not result into conversion, would signalise to test the next
	steps after the feature was clicked. It is also a very general measurement and can be applied to most of the features
	tested on deepl.com, whether this is a button or a translation window, etc.
	
	2. Time spent (on a page or a specific region of interest - use the heatmap analysis): continuous variable - is also
	general and reflects the users interest. Can indicate that the information is boring (too many words), does not attract
	attention (ugly color, design), at the wrong place.

	3. Visitors - it is important to track visitors not sessions, this gives a deeper insight into users behaviour. One
	can understand, what drives the users decision to convert, how conversion correlates with number of sessions, text size.
	
Using these features together with the conversion and number of translated characters, one can create multiple metrics:
	
	1. clicks per views (sessions), clicks per user, clicks per time spent; 
	2. the same for conversion
	3. avg. values of the features: per dataset, per user, per session
	4. bounce rate, churn rate,...
